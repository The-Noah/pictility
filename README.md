Simple CLI tool for managing photos for photographers.

## Under Development

This project is under development. It is not ready for production use.

## Why?

I am a photographer and I've found the tools for editing photos to be less than ideal. I use Adobe Lightroom for editing and Adobe Bridge for managing, with my own folder structure. Unfortunately, Lightroom is cloud based (I know Lightroom Classic exists, but it didn't work for me either). I have to manually import photos, export them as RAWs, move the files, and export JPEGs from Bridge. This tool is an attempt to partially automate this process.
